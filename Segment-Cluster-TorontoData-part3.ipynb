    "Use a Notebook to build the code to scrap Toronto neighborhood data on Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M), wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe in a structured form as follows:\n",
    "  - This pandas dataframe will consist of three columns: PostalCode, Borough, and Neighborhood\n",
    "  - Only process the cells that have an assigned borough. \n",
    "    * Ignore cells with a borough that is Not assigned\n",
    "  - More than one neighborhood can exist in one postal code area. \n",
    "    * When a postal code area has multiple neighborhoods, separate them with a comma \n",
    "    * For example, in the table on the Wiki page, notice that M5A is listed twice and has two neighborhoods: Harbourfront and Regent Park.\n",
    "These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma as shown in row 11 in the above table\n",
    "  - If a cell has a borough but a Not assigned neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough\n",
    "\n",
    "Add Markdown cells to explain the work and any assumptions being made. Also in the last cell of the notebook, use the .shape method to print the number of rows of the dataframe."
